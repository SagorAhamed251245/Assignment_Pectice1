  /* You are given an object representing a book with properties title (string), author (string), and publishedYear (number). Use type alias for declaring the object. Write a TypeScript function called isRecentBook that takes this book object as input and determines if the book was published in the last 5 years.

    Hints: Use getFullYear() method to extract the year to check the given year with current year.
